# AI-Powered Fitness Platform

An innovative, full-stack fitness application that uses AI and computer vision to provide personalized workout guidance and real-time form correction. The platform is designed to transform the user's fitness journey through intelligent, data-driven recommendations.

### 🌟 Features

* **AI-Powered Pose Estimation:** Real-time analysis of user movements to provide accurate feedback on form.
* **Full-Stack Architecture:** A robust backend built with Python that serves the front-end client, written in TypeScript.
* **Modular Front-End:** A component-based client-side structure for a clean, scalable, and maintainable user interface.
* **Workout and Training Models:** Integration of various AI models to support different fitness goals.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * TypeScript
    * JavaScript
    * Vite (for building and development)
    * CSS / HTML
* **Backend:**
    * Python
    * Server-side Framework (likely Express.js or similar based on package.json, for handling client requests)
* **AI/Machine Learning:**
    * Pose Estimation libraries (e.g., pose_estimation_server.py)

### 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/donaldritch5865/project3.0.git](https://github.com/donaldritch5865/project3.0.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd project3.0
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies for the client:**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies for the server:**
    ```bash
    cd ../server
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: The actual server might not have a `requirements.txt` based on the file list, but this is a standard command for Python projects)*

### 🏃‍♂️ Usage

* Start the server to run the AI models and handle requests.
* Start the client to view the front-end application in your browser.

*(Add specific command lines for starting the server and client here, once you have them.)*
